Time range: 9:00AM to 10:00AM

Description: I played around with varilog and made some fun graphics. I started with the serpensky triangle (black and white) and then, since that's checking if a bitwise AND was equal to zero, I thought just getting rid of the equal statement and using the eight bits directly. Since I'm not using [1:0], it ignores those bits. Now I just have to think of a project idea.
